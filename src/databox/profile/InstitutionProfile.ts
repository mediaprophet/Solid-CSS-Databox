 * destructive retention, a Blocked feature) and **fails closed on unknown security-critical fields**.
 *
 * This module defines the versioned schema's TypeScript loader types plus the closed value sets the
 * validator enforces. It deliberately references — and never resolves — the Blocked sub-questions of
 * ADR-0005 (RFC 8693 wire semantics), ADR-0015 (legal-compliance release gate) and ADR-0021
 * (provider-blind encryption): the schema can *carry* those declarations, but the validator refuses to
