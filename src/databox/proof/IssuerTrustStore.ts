/**
 * The trusted-issuer + key-history store for record-proof verification (ADR-0020 §6, DBX-16).
 *
 * Verification MUST resolve the signing key from a TRUSTED source keyed by the program's issuer set — never
 * from the JWS header or the payload (a header-supplied key is attacker-controlled). This store is that
 * source. It also enforces **key history**:
 *
 * - a `rotated` key still verifies records **issued within its validity window** (a since-rotated key keeps
 *   historical records verifiable — ADR-0019/0020);
 * - a `revoked` key — the stolen/compromised-key case (T-20) — never verifies, not even a historical record,
 *   because its private half can no longer be trusted;
 * - a key used **outside** its `[validFrom, validUntil)` window (before it existed, or after it was retired)
 *   is rejected — this denies an attacker minting a "historical" record with a retired verification method.
 *
 * Trusted issuers are a **per-program** profile choice (ADR-0020 §Open sub-questions, ADR-0006 DBX-06), so
 * the store is scoped to one program and constructed from that program's key descriptors.
