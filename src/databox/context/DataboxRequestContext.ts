 * Databox authenticated request context (component C3, DBX-04 §2).

 * This is the immutable, request-scoped verified context that the Databox builds from a verified
 * token. It is deliberately richer than the CSS `Credentials` type, which captures only
 * `agent`/`client`/`issuer` and carries no assurance, audience or delegation information
 * (DBX-01 §2 — "the single biggest gap"). None of these fields exist in CSS 7.1.9 today.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: A `DataboxRequestContext` is evidence about *who is asking*, never a grant.
 * Possessing a context MUST NOT be treated as authorization; the composed authorizer (C4) still
 * decides. The context owner (C3) is authoritative for the assurance state and fails closed
 * (DBX-04 §6). Every field is `readonly` and the value is deep-frozen at construction, so no
 * downstream layer (authorizer/operation/audit) can mutate a verified claim.
