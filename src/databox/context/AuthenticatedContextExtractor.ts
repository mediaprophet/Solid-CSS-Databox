 * JWT decode for assurance/actor/delegation (ADR-0010, T-12): the only assurance source is the enriched
 * {@link VerifiedClaimSet}, and only claims the crosswalk maps raise a grade. It fails closed —
 *
 * - no enriched claims → lowest assurance, but the conforming Solid-OIDC path is preserved (T-16);
 * - claims from an issuer the program did not approve → rejected (T-13);
 * - an enriched issuer that disagrees with the credential issuer → rejected (confused deputy, T-13/T-15);
 * - claims the crosswalk does not map → ignored, so a forged/novel claim cannot escalate (T-12).
 *
 * HARD PRECONDITION on the enriched path (review findings 2 & 3): a `VerifiedClaimSet` is trusted ONLY
 * when it is bound to CSS-verified credentials. The broker (C9) obligation is that the enriched claims
 * and the CSS access token describe the SAME subject. This extractor enforces that:
 *
 * - a `VerifiedClaimSet` MUST be backed by a CSS-verified `credentials.issuer` and a CSS-verified subject
 *   (WebID or client) — enriched claims are NEVER synthesised into a context on their own (finding 3);
 * - where the enriched claims also carry a `webId`/`clientId`, it MUST equal the CSS-verified one, else
 *   the request is rejected (cross-subject confused deputy, finding 2 / T-14). The context's identity is
 *   always sourced from the CSS-verified credentials, never from the enriched claims.
 *
 * The actor and represented entity are kept DISTINCT (architecture.md, T-14/T-47). The RFC 8693 subject/
 * actor-token wire binding is Blocked (ADR-0005): this extractor carries the delegation *claim* as a
 * provisional seam and never authorizes it — the grant is validated per-op by C4/C9.
