/**
 * The real C5 tenant resolver (DBX-11), replacing the fail-closed stub.
 *
 * It resolves the *authoritative* tenant of the request from the **target box** — the resource's owning
 * tenant comes from the protected box→relationship mapping (DBX-10), which no credential can spoof — and
 * then requires that every credential fact the request presents (token audience, request origin, bridge
 * service identity) agrees with that one tenant, via the program-bound {@link TenantBindingRegistry}
 * (ADR-0002/ADR-0016). Any disagreement, or a request that carries no tenant-binding fact at all, denies.
 *
 * Threats closed here (all deny with the identical existence-hiding response, no leak):
 * - **T-01** host/path swap: a valid token for program A's box, target rewritten to program B's box,
 *   fails because B's tenant does not match A's audience/origin.
 * - **T-02** cross-program bridge credential: program A's service identity presented against program B's
 *   box is refused (the service identity resolves to A, the box to B).
 * - **T-31** platform-wide data-plane credential: structurally impossible — a service identity/audience/
 *   origin can be bound to only one tenant (see {@link TenantBindingRegistry}); a fact that resolves to
 *   no single tenant is denied.
 *
 * The resolved tenant is returned as an immutable, deep-frozen {@link TenantContext} carried into the
 * operation; the store boundary re-validates it via `TenantIsolationGuard` to close the T-54 race.
