### Key Gaps

1. **MkDocs** is entirely upstream CSS — zero Databox content, wrong site name, wrong repo URL.
2. **gh-pages landing page** is missing: full CMS module catalog, org mobile apps, tradie app, Rust sidecar/proxy/supervisor, compliance engine, evidence ledger, policy engine, review workflow, credential lifecycle, deployment guides, test coverage.
3. **README.md** is missing: CMS module system, native/Rust components, org mobile apps, tradie app, deployment guides, test coverage detail.
4. **Org mobile apps** and **tradie app** are not mentioned in any public-facing documentation outside their own READMEs.
5. **Rust components** (connector-sidecar, pos-edge-proxy, tray-supervisor) are not documented anywhere.
6. **Deployment guides** (Docker, Kubernetes) are not linked from README or gh-pages.
