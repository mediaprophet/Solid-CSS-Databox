# DBX-02 — Normative Decision Register (index)

**Prompt:** DBX-02 (Wave A). **Agent level:** Hard. **Depends on:** DBX-01.
**Status:** complete. **Baseline pinned by:** [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-specification-baseline-pinning.md).

This register is the single source of truth for every binding Databox decision. Each decision is one ADR
under `databox/decisions/`, following [ADR-TEMPLATE.md](ADR-TEMPLATE.md). This index maps every input
question — the 18 implementation-review items, S-01…S-27, R-01…R-14, HD-01…HD-16, and the DBX-02 prompt's
explicit topic list — to the ADR that resolves it, so a dependent prompt can confirm **no contract depends
on an undocumented choice** (the DBX-02 acceptance gate). Unresolved items are listed in §6 with the exact
input that unblocks them and the prompts they block.

## 1. Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Adopted** | A binding Databox requirement, fully specified for its scope. |
| **Adopted-with-scope** | Adopted now for a bounded scope; a named production/legal extension is deferred. |
| **Profile choice** | Each program must declare and validate its choice; the register fixes the frame. |
| **Blocked (decision required)** | Cannot be finalised yet; §6 names the unblocking input, its owner, and the prompts blocked. |
| **Rejected-as-stated** | The proposed answer would create false assurance/unsafe behavior; the ADR records the safe replacement. |

## 3. Coverage — implementation-review items (1–18)

Every item in [implementation-decisions.md](../implementation-decisions.md) is adjudicated. "Verdict"
records how this register resolves it (several were **Rejected-as-stated** in the source and the ADR keeps
the safe replacement).

| Item | Question (abbrev.) | ADR | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Which IdPs accepted? | 0005 | Profile choice (per-program trust contract) |
| 2 | Broker / token exchange required? | 0005 | Adopted (separately deployable broker) |
| 3 | LoA → access grade | 0010 | Adopted (multi-dimension crosswalk) |
| 4 | Connection credential = long-running authority? | 0007 | Adopted (holder-bound, not bearer) |
| 5 | Bind WebID + DID + key? | 0004 | Rejected-as-stated (WebID + holder key; DID optional) |
| 6 | Refresh / revoke / step-up | 0009 | Adopted (no default refresh; prompt revocation) |
| 7 | WebSockets required? | 0011 | Adopted (No — HTTPS authoritative) |
| 8 | LDN mandatory durable baseline? | 0011 | Adopted (No — cursor feed is the contract) |
| 9 | Recover missed events from outbox? | 0011 | Rejected-as-stated (define cursor recovery API) |
| 10 | When is a notify duty fulfilled? | 0012 | Adopted (typed duties, distinct states) |
| 11 | ELI provides versioning/pinning? | 0015, 0014 | Rejected-as-stated (immutable corpus manifest) |
| 12 | Evaluator decides commencement/repeal? | 0015 | Rejected-as-stated (compilation stage + attestation) |
| 13 | Machine outputs proposed until attested? | 0015 | Adopted-with-scope |
| 14 | WebCivics→ODRL mapping already defined? | 0013, 0015 | Decision required → owned by DBX-07 |
| 15 | Policy conflict precedence settled? | 0013 | Adopted (deterministic 5-stage strategy) |
| 16 | Appeal = step-up or staff queue? | 0023 | Rejected-as-single-choice (both, distinct routes) |
| 17 | Policy updates affect only new records? | 0014 | Rejected-as-stated (effective-time + re-eval rules) |
| 18 | Receipt proves governing corpus? | 0019, 0020 | Rejected-as-stated (multi-digest binding) |

## 4. Coverage — Solid/LWS interoperability questions (S-01…S-27)

Each is **resolved** by an ADR or explicitly routed to a later prompt as a **residual gate** (never left
undocumented). None is Blocked.

| S | ADR(s) | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| S-01 | 0001 | Resolved — signed baseline manifest |
| S-02 | 0002 | Resolved — advertised storage subtree topology |
| S-03 | 0005, 0025 | Resolved — independent issuer/WebID after onboarding |
| S-04 | 0005 | Resolved — conforming Solid-OIDC path preserved |
| S-05 | 0025 | Resolved — adopted Solid-OIDC client identification |
| S-06 | 0004 | Resolved — user-controlled pairwise WebID |
| S-07 | 0025, 0018 | Resolved — capability matrix; append-only via method denial |
| S-08 | 0003 | Resolved — WAC baseline, narrow-never-broaden |
| S-09 | 0025 | Resolved — standard discovery, no hidden SDK registry |
| S-10 | 0025 | Resolved — safely-ignorable RDF extensions |
| S-11 | 0011 | Resolved — Solid channels vs Databox durable contract separated |
| S-12 | 0025 | Resolved — standard codes/challenges, no existence leak |
| S-13 | 0025 | Resolved — CORS/credentials/CSRF rules defined |
| S-14 | 0020, 0025 | Resolved — offline verification, pinned contexts |
| S-15 | 0025 | Resolved — guaranteed basic experience + progressive enhancement |
| S-16 | 0025 | Resolved (frame); **residual gate:** ≥2 independent stacks + 1 issuer proof → DBX-27 |
| S-17 | 0024, 0001 | Resolved — compatibility manifest + upstream-change watch |
| S-18 | 0024 | Resolved — separate Track A / Track B results |
| S-19 | 0006, 0008 | Resolved — LWS access-request/grant carries the ceremony |
| S-20 | 0005 | Resolved — broker is the LWS AS where Track B enabled |
| S-21 | 0006 | Resolved — OIDC + self-signed CID; SAML/DID optional |
| S-22 | 0004 | Resolved — typed directional identifier bindings |
| S-23 | 0006, 0009 | Resolved — Bearer for low grades, sender-constraint for high |
| S-24 | 0002 | Resolved — organisation is storage controller/custodian |
| S-25 | 0024, 0025 | Resolved — versioned adapters; Track A unchanged by Track B |
| S-26 | 0011, 0024 | Resolved — LWS notification text is not the durable contract |
| S-27 | 0024 | Resolved — maturity/graduation gate for WD features |

## 6. Blocked / gated decisions (the only unresolved items) and what they block

Two Blocked sub-questions and one Blocked release gate. Each names its unblocking input, owner, and blocked
prompts — nothing else in the register is unresolved.

| Where | What is Blocked | Unblocking input (owner) | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ADR-0005](ADR-0005-authorization-server-broker-and-idp-trust.md) §residual | Exact RFC 8693 wire semantics binding the connection credential + fresh holder-key proof into token exchange (subject- vs actor-token) | The token-exchange ADR against the pinned LWS draft (**DBX-12**, with DBX-13) | DBX-12; the unattended-sync path of HAK-04. The rest of ADR-0005 (broker adoption, per-program IdP trust) is Adopted and unblocks DBX-04/DBX-06 now. |
| [ADR-0021](ADR-0021-encryption-boundary.md) §residual | Whether/how a high-assurance **provider-blind** encryption profile is offered | Custodianship/legal determination (**ADR-0002 + R-12 legal workstream**) + key-custody design from a **named security reviewer** | Only the provider-blind profile. TLS (mandatory) and at-rest-per-tenant (Profile choice) are decided; DBX-11 proceeds. |
| [ADR-0015](ADR-0015-legal-policy-compilation-boundary.md) §residual | **Legal-compliance release gate** | (1) actual legislation corpus ingested + content-digest-pinned; (2) authorized human attestation of the WebCivics/legal→ODRL mapping (**separate Hard legal-policy prompt via DBX-07**; accountable human legal reviewer) | Only a legal-compliance *release claim* (and the CDR profile in ADR-0023). All technical work on synthetic policies (DBX-07, DBX-20) is explicitly **not** gated. |

## 7. Residual human-review gates (DBX-02 rule)

Per the plan, cryptographic/identity ADRs need Hard + human security/identity review, and ODRL/legal ADRs
need human policy review, before the dependent production code is accepted. These are **not** self-certified
by DBX-02. Flagged for human review: **security/identity** — ADR-0002, 0003, 0004, 0005, 0006, 0007, 0008,
0009, 0010; **cryptography** — ADR-0006, 0007, 0015, 0020; **legal-policy** — ADR-0015, 0021, 0023. The
independent Hard reviewer for the authorization composition is scheduled at DBX-14; adversarial tenant
review at DBX-11/DBX-26.

## 8. Acceptance-gate self-check

- **"No later contract depends on an undocumented choice":** §§3–5 map every review item, S-question,
  R-recommendation, HD-decision and DBX-02 topic to a specific ADR. ✔
- **"Unresolved decisions explicitly identify which prompts they block":** §6 lists all three Blocked items
  with unblocking input, owner and blocked prompts; the rest of each partially-blocked ADR is Adopted and
  unblocks its consumers now. ✔
- **"Alternatives, consequences, recommendation, status per decision":** every ADR carries Alternatives,
  Consequences, Failure behavior and a Status field per [ADR-TEMPLATE.md](ADR-TEMPLATE.md). ✔
- **"Pin the dated specification baseline":** [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-specification-baseline-pinning.md). ✔
